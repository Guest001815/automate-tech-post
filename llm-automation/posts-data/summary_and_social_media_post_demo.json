        "summary": "This blog post is a tutorial on using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in NumPy to compress an image. The tutorial explains the difference between one-, two-, and n-dimensional arrays in NumPy, applying linear algebra operations to n-dimensional arrays without using for-loops, and understanding axis and shape properties for n-dimensional arrays. The tutorial demonstrates how to use SVD to generate a compressed approximation of an image, apply SVD to all color channels, and rebuild the approximation to obtain the final compressed image.",
