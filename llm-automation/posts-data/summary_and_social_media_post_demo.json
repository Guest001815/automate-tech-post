        "summary": "In this tutorial, the author demonstrates how to use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) – a matrix decomposition from linear algebra – to generate a compressed approximation of an image using NumPy. The tutorial explains the difference between dimensions and axes in NumPy, how to extract data from an image, and how to perform linear algebra operations on the RGB channels of the image. By applying SVD to the image, the author shows how to reconstruct both the full and approximated image, which highlights how well an image can be represented using fewer singular values. The tutorial is useful for those who want to understand image compression and related linear algebra concepts using Python and NumPy.",
